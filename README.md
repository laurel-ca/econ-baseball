Hi! This project was for my Firm Competition economics class at Notre Dame, which was taught by Prof. Jeff Thurk in Fall 2019.
The project focuses on the determining if there is any effect on the attendance of a professional baseball team when another baseball team in the same city performs well. 

Main Question: Does the quality of the performance of another team in the same market affect a team’s attendance?

Project Intro:
For many baseball fans, attending a rival team in the same market as their favorite team may be unthinkable. Especially with the rise of social media and the widerspread of information, baseball teams today can build strong fanbases. Many teams have been able to harness their brand equity in order to sell tickets and merchandise, resulting in more revenue. However, even with strong fan loyalty, people may be more willing to attend a game if the home team has been playing well recently. People may also jump onto a team’s bandwagon even if they did not support them in the past. In 2016, when the Chicago Cubs were on their way to winning the World Series, many people suddenly became supportive of the team even though they were notoriously bad in the past. That year, attendance at home games increased by about 10% from 2015. At the same time, attendance at Chicago White Sox games decreased from the previous year on average, but only slightly.
